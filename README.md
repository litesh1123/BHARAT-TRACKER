## Tools
### Flutter: 
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It allows developers to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. In your project, Flutter is used to develop the user interface and functionality of the mobile application for your eco-friendly social media platform.

### Firebase: 
Firebase is a platform developed by Google for building and managing mobile and web applications. It offers a variety of services such as authentication, real-time database, cloud storage, hosting, and more. In your project, Firebase is utilized for user authentication, storing user data, managing tasks and rewards, handling file uploads, and conducting security audits.

### Gemini: 
Gemini is a cryptocurrency exchange and custodian that allows users to buy, sell, and store various cryptocurrencies. In our project, Gemini may be integrated to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions or donations for eco-friendly causes or incentives within your social media platform.

### Vertex AI: 
Vertex AI is a machine learning platform provided by Google Cloud that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage machine learning models at scale. In our project, Vertex AI have been used to train and deploy machine learning models for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, or predictive analytics to enhance the functionality of your social media platform.

### Google Analytics: 
Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website and app traffic. It provides valuable insights into user behavior, user demographics, traffic sources, and more. In your project, Google Analytics is used to track user engagement metrics, such as the number of users, sessions, page views, and interactions within the app.

### Google Cloud:
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services provided by Google, including computing, storage, machine learning, and data analytics. In your project, Google Cloud may be used for various purposes such as hosting the backend infrastructure, storing user data, analyzing user behavior, and implementing machine learning algorithms.

### Machine Learning: 
Machine learning involves building algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. In your project, machine learning may be used for tasks such as analyzing user behavior patterns, recommending personalized content or eco-friendly activities, detecting anomalies or security threats, and optimizing the user experience based on user preferences.
