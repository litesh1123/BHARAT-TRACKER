# BHARAT TRACKER

Our project is all about a social media platform where users are encouraged to perform ecofriendly activities to save planet earth .Through our project , we are taking different measures towards protecting environment from various challenges such as climate issues , global warming and other. The first step of our project is to login into the app so that the users get an opportunity to post his/her activity which is opted towards protecting environment such as using paper bags instead of plastic bags ,etc. These posted activities motivates others to contribute for the betterment of mother earth as well. In our project , we have also set some tasks which the users can perform and contribute for earth . By performing the tasks on regular basis , the users will be ranked in the leaderboard and get rewards for their active participation . Basically this project is all about encouraging people to save earth from being devastated.
